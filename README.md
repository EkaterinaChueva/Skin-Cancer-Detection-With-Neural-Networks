Final project for Vision and Cognitive Systems course 2023-2024 held by prof. L. Ballan by Oksana Abramova and Ekaterina Chueva.

## **Abstract**

This project explores the application of computer vision techniques for skin cancer detection with the task of image classification. The methodology involved data preprocessing, model training and optimisation. We initially
constructed a convolutional neural network model (CNN) as a baseline, followed by integrating transfer learning and simple attention mechanism to improve the results. Models of ResNet and DenseNet families were used for transfer
learning as well as for exploring the effect of several modifications to the architecture.
The results highlight the effectiveness of the chosen architectures in automated skin cancer detection showcasing the potential of these techniques to assist in early diagnosis. The best model in our case was found to be pre-trained
ResNet-50 with modifications, which achieved 91.7% accuracy.
